   short: "An overview of our administration and moderation philosophy"
};

Welcome to the Prosperity staff team. This document intends to serve as an introduction to our ideas on administration and your expected behavior as a staff member. You are given a great deal of trust and the ability to have a lasting impact on the server, so please read and consider this carefully, and feel free to ask questions.

To begin, it is important to outline the core principles of administration on Prosperity:

1. **Fairness and respect:** Treat members with fairness and respect, regardless their age, ethnicity, skill level, or identity.
2. **Transparency:** The reasons for staff actions should be made clear, and discussion should be open between members of the server and staff, with exception to special cases.
3. **Understanding and trust:** In general, members should be given the benefit of the doubt, with respect to their previous actions and position in the community. Staff actions should be taken with the knowledge that many people spend a significant amount of time on the server.
   While these are not hard and fast rules, these principles should help inform what and how actions are taken as a staff member.

## Expectations

As a staff member we ask that you do your best to keep tabs on who is active and doing what on the server, and try to maintain an active presence yourself. While we don't enforce any minimum amount of activity or moderation actions that need to be done, it is important that you are engaged with the server to perform your duties optimally.

Your attitude as a staff member is extremely important, as your actions and behavior are usually perceived as more valid and/or endorsed. Your attitude as a staff member should be that of a regular player, although one with the ability to improve the server and fix issues greater than others. While your attitude when directly dealing with staff duties is much more important, we ask that you maintain a level of maturity overall when interacting on the server.

### Accountability

Be aware that you are accountable for your actions as a staff member, and are not immune to punishment. If you abuse your power or take actions in bad faith these will be punished severely.

On a related point, you are also accountable for the security of your accounts and devices. We ask that you be aware of the security of your accounts, and ideally enable 2-factor-authentication. If you use a shared computer or are in a similar situation, we ask that you take steps to prevent unauthorized access.

## Responsibilities

As a moderator on Prosperity you are given many duties and responsibilities. These include handling and responding to player reports, enforcing the server rules, reading and deciding on whitelist applications, and generally being an upstanding member of the community. There is more information and specific advice for handling each of these duties in the other staff wiki pages.

When dealing with staff duties we ask that you try to keep a level head and handle situations in the least disruptive way possible. If you do not want, or are unable to deal with a situation feel free to step back.
