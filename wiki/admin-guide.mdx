This document intends to serve as a guide to Prosperity's moderation policy, and includes some examples of punishments to help inform your actions. The intention of moderation on Prosperity is to keep the community clean and friendly, and not to allow bad actors and toxicity to take root.

## Moderation Policy

Overall Prosperity's moderation policy is designed to be fair and to create the best server possible, while not being overbearing. Prosperity is intended to be a long-term server, and it is a place where people dedicate a significant portion of their free time, so we try to avoid complete bans and unreasonably harsh punishment if possible. While people can change, we also don't believe that toxicity should be allowed to fester.

With the philosophy out of the way, here are some specific guidelines for moderation:

1. Do not discriminate based off of age, identity, skill level, or your personal feelings towards another member.
2. Prefer temporary bans, kicks, and mutes for low-level offenses.
3. Have a zero-tolerance policy on bigotry and toxicity.
4. Apply all rules as fairly and consistently as possible.
5. Make moderation actions in the least disruptive way possible.
6. Don't kill friendly banter and trolling, but don't let it get out of hand.

### Handling Moderation Actions

In the event that you need to ban a player make sure to provide a detailed and clear explanation of why that action was taken. If a player wishes to appeal a ban direct them to the "Player Report" form in Gather. When a player is banned from one server, make sure to also ban them on the other. If a player is temporarily banned you can assign the `@Banned Player` role to them, which will give them limited access to the Discord.

### Examples

Here are a few theoretical examples of moderation cases and how you might handle them. While every situation is unique and should be handled in a slightly different way, you can use these examples to inform how to handle new and unique cases. Note that not all of these examples are based on real events.

- In situations where a discussion that seems inappropriate for the server, such as one related to politics, comes up in chat you should ask politely to end the discussion or move it to private messages. If they do not stop the conversation, mute them for a short amount of time (5 - 10 minutes).
- In situations where an otherwise upstanding member of the community is spamming or otherwise being disruptive, they should be asked politely to stop, or if they continue, met with a mute and warn.
- A situation where a player is found to be stealing from other players or otherwise committing low-level rule violations should be resolved with a warning or a short temporary ban (5 - 14 days) and returning the stolen items, if applicable.
- A situation where a player is found to be intentionally griefing should be met with a permanent ban and the best effort taken to restore the damage.

## Tools & Resources

To assist in moderation on Prosperity we take advantage of various tools on Discord and Minecraft. It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with these because they will save you time at the least, and are required in many cases.

### Discord Bots

We make use of various Discord bots, namely [LilyBot](https://github.com/HyacinthBots/LilyBot) for moderation and utility, [Gather](https://gather.sh) for whitelist and report forms, and [RedBot (Prosperity Bot)](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) for various miscellaneous features. This is subject to change as we are in the process of changing around our bots, so keep your eye on this section.

### Ledger

[Ledger](https://modrinth.com/mod/ledger) is a block logging mod which keeps track of blocks placed, entities, items, and has the ability to manage rollbacks. This tool is extremely useful when investigating player reports and to fix problems in Minecraft.

### Banhammer

[Banhammer](https://modrinth.com/mod/banhammer) is a ban utility mod for tracking and providing reasons for bans in Minecraft. It replaces the vanilla ban commands (which are available as `/minecraft:kick` and `/minecraft:ban`) and also adds the ability to mute and temporarily ban a user.

### WorldEdit

[WorldEdit](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit) is a building utility mod with many many features. This is unlikely to be used often, however if it does need to be used you should really know what you're doing with it.

## General Tips

- **Get to know the community:** The best way to help moderate a community is to understand it, to this end you should get to know the community and the people who are most active.
- **Be consistent:** Try and be consistent with previous moderation actions and the opinions of other staff members.
- **Keep moderation in the right channels:** Make sure to direct all moderation related issues to the report form in Discord. Handling moderation in various direct message channels is a mess!
- **Understand the server:** Do your best to understand the rules of the server and what is possible with Prosperity's custom configuration and mods.
- **Do not tolerate harmful behavior:** Be quick to moderate hateful and harmful behavior, as this can quickly lead to a decline in the community.
