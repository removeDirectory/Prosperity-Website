This document aims to provide an explanation of what we expect from our members, both before joining the server and then whilst being a member.

## Prospective Members

In order to maintain quality within the server, we expect a certain level of experience prior to joining the server. Whilst we have no hard and fast rule about what is considered enough experience to join, images of a few builds should be provided to demonstrate one's ability. As a technical server, these builds should ideally include an amount of redstone, however we understand that a few screenshots will not show an individual's grasp of technical Minecraft.

Due to the nature of our community, we generally have a minimum age of around 16, however we do accept anyone over 13 (as per Discord Terms of Service) dependant on meeting our whitelist criteria.

The whitelisting process consists of a simple form with 10 or so questions, centered on one's playstyle and previous builds.

## Server Members

We have two main expectations of our members:
1. **Follow the Rules**: They exist for a reason, and should be followed at all times
2. **Respect One Another**: This community relies on mutual respect between all members, and this needs to be maintained
